The `uml` folder contains the UML diagrams for modeling beer fermentation in an artisanal brewery.

The `embedded` folder refers to a project where the temperature and humidity of an environment are monitored using an ESP32 module and the data is stored in a Firebase database. There is also a Node-RED server that controls the ESP32 work cycle and provides a dashboard to visualize the data acquired by the ESP32 in real-time.
